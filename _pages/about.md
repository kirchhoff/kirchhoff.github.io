Hello, I am Wenda Tang (汤闻达). I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University, under the supervision of Prof. [Wanchun Dou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/douwanchun/index.htm). My thesis is about resource scheduling in Cloud computing. Now, I am a Principal Researcher at China Telecom Cloud Computing Research Institute. My research interests lie in the area of disaggregated memory architecture, CXL, NVM, and QoS-aware resource scheduling.
